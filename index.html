  <p>Look at all those posters just above. They were all films that had their merits but were subjected to review bombing campaigns purely out of petty reasons. This is a widespread thing, that many of the most vocal critics about certain pieces of narrative media, are often being toxic. And if they're not being toxic, then they're not using clever, in-depth arguments, and are instead reviewing things based on their own opinions and feelings on various matters. This website is designed to combat those criticisms, by instead focusing on the greater aspects of films. There will be things like <a href="criticisms.html">what kind of criticisms people target at films are insipid and shallow</a> and <a href="plotholes.html">various kinds of plot holes that are actually quite criticisable</a> to lay some ground rules.  We need this website because of how low we've stooped that it isn't easy to find actual clever reviews nowadays.</p>

  <p>Now I'd like to spend this next paragraph going into a little more detail about how flawed these mindsets and campaigns are, as they don't examine the films for their quality, and instead examine the films for their own personal relationship with them. Now, examining the film from your experience in the cinema isn't a bad thing, as that doesn't distract from the actual story of the film, but discussing the quality of a film, using your own idea of what the film should be as a yardstick for how good the film is, is a terrible way to review films. Instead of focusing on what the story says, they focus on what they want the story to say, and refuse to accept that they didn't make this film, and they don't have a right to get annoyed at a film for not being the story they want. Take <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, a film that many people lambasted purely for the sake of it not adhering to their unfair and ridiculous rules. This is why we need more websites like this, that prevent fans from being toxic.</p>

  <p>Other campaigns like this purely come from bigotry and prejudice, such as the well-known campaigns to review bomb <em>Ghostbusters (2016)</em> and <em>Captain Marvel</em>, which often came from people explicitly being misogynist, or in a similar situation, masking their misogyny and pathological views, by claiming that their views are purely influenced by loyalness to the work, and think that even putting in a slightly different twist on their beloved films is a complete personal betrayal to them, and all that they stand for. This isn't really good for reviewing as a whole, because it leads to create a further bridge between proper highbrow critics and people like me, who discuss things in a very independent, opinion-based way, and this style of writing being associated with incredibly toxic fans, would be a kind of sad way for everything to go. And this is why I have made this website. So that this line of thinking is prevented. And I hope that you, you and your individual self agrees with me, because if enough individuals agree with me, then we can culminate in reclaiming media consumption from the cesspool of online toxicity that it's currently in.</p>

  <p>So, you know what I think that you should do, with this newfound information, is be a little more positive about media. After all, right now, Hollywood is practically always returning to the well of nostalgia to adapt, and then create a sequel for, a system which was much less prevalent in times like the 80s and 90s, where most of the films we're getting sequels to now, were made. And we should be appreciative of them, because many of them do offer up large amounts of fanservice. And that's fine, but it can come at the expense of a story, and having a film that tries to equally offer both, is a much better situation, because it means that it will manage to satisfy us, and yet challenge us. This is where we got some incredible new franchise films like <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, which was not only an incredible movie, but grossed well over a billion dollars, and is still the 14th highest grossing film of all time. But other than that, it seems that films that offer fanservice and a story like <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> don't get the same critical appraisal, and it's a very sad thing. This is why I think that we should have better criticisms.</p>
