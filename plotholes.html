   <h1>4 Times Plot Holes Are Criticisable</h1>
   <p>I personally believe that plot holes are often cheap shots made by people who don't know any better. However, I also think that credit should be where credit's due, because there are a number of good things about plot holes that I feel like don't apply to this rule. I'm here to write reasons as to why I believe each of these examples is criticisable. This list will not include things like "Inconsistent characterisation", or "Continuity errors", or "Things happening offscreen", because those are all things that aren't fair to criticise. Inconsistent characterisation, besides being a general part of all films and television shows, often amounts to characters acting rashly or impulsively, in a way that doesn't more drag the story out, and more stops it from being 30 seconds long. Continuity errors, as mentioned on the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>, are really fans superimposing their own ridiculous rules over that of the writer, in a massive superiority complex. And things happening offscreen, should go without saying, but some things don't always happen onscreen. It's as simple as that. And this list won't be looking at those. This list will be looking at what is fair criticism, and which plot holes in films actually serve as a detriment to the film's quailty, an aspect that is needed when criticising plot holes, even if it seems like people don't seem to realise that. Now, anyways, let's get started with this list.</p>
   <h3>4. Really, really bad plot contrivances (i.e Star Trek (2009))</h3>

   <p>Now plot contrivances (Contrived coincidence that happen so that the film's story can continue) are again, really just a part of storytelling. A good example of this is the way that many characters plans' work. Take Luke Skywalker's plan to escape being captured by Jabba the Hutt in <em>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</em>, as the plan relies solely on R2-D2 still being intact, and in the right place at the right time to give Luke his lightsaber. This is a good example of a plot contrivance that is not relevant, because it's both an awesome moment, and you don't immediately start thinking about plot holes in this situation.</p>
   <p>However, this is not always the case. <em>Star Trek (2009)</em>, and a lot of J.J. Abrams' writing in general are often filled with plot contrivances too big to ignore. I put an image above, which is a great example, as during the film after Kirk is sent to another planet, in an incredibly coincidental fashion, it turns out to be the planet where a much older Spock is hanging out, and now Kirk can sit through a long exposition dump that explains how this universe ties into the canon. The real big problem with this here, that many other contrivances don't have, is that it's easy to think to one's self "How is this world so contrived that across an entire galaxy, our two main characters ended up meeting up?", which other plot contrivances don't have. So, this one can be complained about, but others shouldn't be.</p>
   <h3>3. Plot holes in a film that's designed to be clever (i.e The Sixth Sense)</h3>
   <img src="The Sixth Sense.png" alt="Bruce Willis">
   <p><em>The Sixth Sense</em> is a great example of a film where many of the plot holes I mentioned earlier, aren't actually so unfair to complain about, and the reason for this is that <em>The Sixth Sense</em> is a film that is very much relying on being clever. The film's main purpose is very much to pull a fast one on people, and deceive them. Watching the film, you spend the whole time thinking to yourself that you understand the story, and then, in the last five minutes, you realise that the paradigm has completely shifted, and that you didn't understand it all. This whole film was a lie. Now, that's fine, except the problem is that it doesn't really work. It's pretty clear by now that if you haven't seen the film you shouldn't be reading this, so I think that it doesn't matter if I say that the film ends by revealing that our heroic character, Bruce Willis has been dead the whole time. As I said before, a film about deception is fine, but the deception has to work by not having those plot holes I mentioned in the first paragraph. And the film absolutely fails on that level.</p>
   <p>We are introduced to vague rules that contradict each other, because the rules of this film revolve around the twist. But the rules don't match up. A good example would be us learning that dead people only see what they want to see, which we learn near the beginning, and it explains how Bruce Willis didn't realise that he was dead this whole time. But this single rule ends up not making any sense, because we generally don't seem to see ghosts seeing what they want to see. Most of the ghosts are in the exact same state that they were when they were dead, and throughout the film, Bruce Willis sees many things that he doesn't like, such as him thinking that his wife is ignoring him, when of course, she can't see him as he's dead. And all of this would completely be fine, if it weren't for the fact that the film is building itself off of these rules. It's purpose is as the twist first, and as the film second, and the only way for that to work, would be if all the rules aligned. And they don't. So that makes this film have plot holes.</p>
   <h3>2. Films that just straight-up don't explain things (i.e The Avengers)</h3>
   <img src="The Avengers.png" alt="Stellan Skarsgard">
   <p>I feel like this is a really obvious example, but it's not even really a plot contrivance, it's more people being able to do things that either aren't brought up again, or just have their explanations avoided. Now, thankfully, this isn't really a widespread plot hole, and I feel like when it's used it's used in the best way possible. The example that I gave was <em>The Avengers</em>, but I feel like it doesn't do this plot hole too badly. The film <em>The Avengers</em> has a scene where Stellan Skarsgard's character, who has been brainwashed the whole movie, reveals that, somehow, while brainwashed, he managed to put a failsafe in the doomsday device he built, which the good guys use to destroy it. Now when he explains in the film, it's immediately followed by an action scene, which both benefits and detriments the scene.</p>
   <p>It benefits those who heard the line, because now that there's an admittedly flimsy reason established, then they immediately forget about it, due to the mood whiplash of the scene inciting the viewers to focus on the action happening right now, and lose interest in what was happening earlier. However, it detriments those who missed that single line, because having a large part of the conflict of the movie be resolved in a throwaway line that many audience members didn't even hear, is unsurprisingly going to lead to a large amount of downsides. Thankfully, this is far from the worst example of a plot hole being put in place, and unlike the other examples on this list which severely weigh down the films that they're in, in many ways, the fact that a throwaway line is one of the worst things about <em>The Avengers</em> makes the film much better plot hole, wise.</p>
   <h3>1. As a sort of general umbrella, films that have you thinking about inconsistencies</h3>
   <p>What really makes people criticising plot holes in films and new releases like <em>A Quiet Place</em> (an incredible film that too many tried to find plot holes in), is that when we watch films like that, we aren't thinking about the plot holes. We aren't asking ourselves, couldn't our heroes just move to the waterfall, and therefore be safe from these monsters. We're thinking about the fact that these guys are in peril, and wondering "How can they survive this?", not just immediately being confused because of unanswered questions. And this is why people shouldn't complain about them online. Because being able to spot things that other people didn't notice doesn't make you a good critic, who's managed to identify the root of the problem. The true thing one should criticise is things that everybody watching notices, often noticing but not being able to put into words. And this is what separates not only this plot hole, but all the others on the list.</p>
   <p>See, all the plot holes on this list (With the exception of no. 3, but that's really more the film's fault then the plot hole's fault), are flawed because you watch the films and notice them. And you can't enjoy the rest of the film, because you're thinking to yourself at the same time, "My disbelief has not been suspended enough for me to be able to handle the fact that things are happening which shouldn't be happening" But people saying things like "Why didn't this character do this thing that would have solved a large part of conflict, and shortened the film down," is missing the point of films. Because consistency has never and will never be what makes something good. What makes something good is how well it immerses you, and how well it works as a concept. If you're watching the film, and going "How many holes can I poke in this story?", because the story holes should come naturally, they shouldn't be looked for. That's the problem here.</p>
   <p>Anyways, I really hope that you enjoyed reading this page, because I've put quite a bit of effort into it, writing out all of this stuff. I really hope that you can go away from this changed, and can understand that really story criticisms shouldn't be something that you look for when you watch a film. They should just come to you, as you realise when something happens, that the Fridge Logic here doesn't work. And I should say that most of the films on this list, I don't think are that bad. I think that <em>The Avengers</em> is a genuinely incredible movie, and while I have slightly more mixed feelings on <em>Star Trek (2009)</em> and <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, I still think that there are many things about those films that I can't really fault. Now I hope I have changed your opinions for the better. Anyways thank you.</p>
