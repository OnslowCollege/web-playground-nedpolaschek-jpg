  <h1>3 Examples of Criticisms That Are Inherently Flawed Cheap Shots</h1>
  <p>This next page is a little bit about looking at criticisms of various films that in general don't work, and are superficial and facile. I'll try to avoid looking at basic plot holes, since I've already done that, but I'll instead be closely examining various things about works that it seems like are criticised many times. A lot of these criticisms are cheap and unfair, and I really want to closely look at those, and see that these criticisms don't work. I've mentioned this on a few other pages, including the <a href="index.html">homepage</a> but I feel like toxicity in fandoms is creating a bit of a negative stereotype for online critics, since a lot of it comes from various incel trolls, and many of the criticisms are nitpicks showing a complete disregard and misunderstanding of how a film is meant to be seen. This type of unfair criticism doesn't really seem to be changing any time soon, and so it is here that we shall look at many "flaws" of films that aren't in fact flaws, but rather, flaws of those criticising them, for not realising how the film is meant to be.</p>
  <h3>Inconsistent Characterisation (i.e Star Wars: The Last Jedi)</h3>

  <p>Inconsistent characterisation isn't really a thing. Ever since stories were first written, there's always been a bit of inconsistent characterisation. Most of it is at the beginning of a story being written, during which the writer hasn't fully fleshed out the characters, and for this reason, often has to do awkward retconning as to how their characters and world works. However, these criticisms usually focus on newer installments, which they believe have betrayed them, due to characters not behaving how they believe they should, and thus they are unhappy, and denounce these characters as unfaithful to their original counterparts. Now, this mindset has many problems. One of the biggest problems is that, they often oversimplify these characters to a single, simple trait, and don't realise how layered and three-dimensional these characters are.</p>
  <p>Like, let's do it using Luke Skywalker from the aforementioned film. In <em>The Last Jedi</em>, Luke is characterised as a bitter, aloof, loner, who has disconnected from the rest of the world, due to his own failings. Many fans were outraged at this new turn of events, believing that the optimistic, all-loving hero would never have abandoned his people in this way. However, these people are ignoring that Luke has always, like all the characters in the film, had an inner dark side. This side of him, was in fact most prevalent in the final film in the trilogy, <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the film that shows him at his most developed, and aspects like his controversial lightsaber throw, were already seen in that film. It's the same with other criticisms of inconsistent characterisation. Many of them don't look at the multitudes and dimensions of the characters in these films, and instead purposefully only look at the things that they want to see so that they can criticise those aspects which don't abide by what they want to see.</p>
  <h3>Introduction of New Ideas (i.e Star Wars: The Last Jedi Again)</h3>
  <img src="Star Wars The Last Jedi (2).png" alt="Master Yoda">
  <p>I'm sorry to talk about <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> just after I was talking about it, but I feel like this is again a great example of something, that's really just the same one as the previous paragraph. The criticism of <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> that I'm discussing is the introduction of new ideas, because throughout this film, and the film released immediately after it (<em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em>) is that they introduced a lot of new ideas to this franchise that many fans disliked. The primary example of new content was new abilities that the force can do, such as how people with the force can now heal the wounded. Another example is that in <em>The Last Jedi</em>, force ghost Yoda is able to use powers despite being dead, an idea that was seen as disrespectful to the lore.</p>
  <p>The problem here is that similar to the above criticism, but here it's really the fact that the force has always and always will be something indescribable. The force exists as a form of energy that's larger than life, and there really is no end to those powers. This was prevalent most of all, in the first 3 films, where the force went from being something that could be used to sort of immerse people's soul, and perform little mind tricks, to being able to give people straight-up superpowers in the second one, to the point that in the third one, a character with the force randomly shoots lightning out of their fingertips, and we understand this because it shows that there is no end to the force. But it feels like people have forgotten that. They've written books that reduce the force to a superpower, something that <em>The Last Jedi</em> explicitly reminds us that the force isn't. Having books which again, the directors are forced to abide by the rules of, only serves to make our characters seem less powerful, as they're not actually using powers, but just obeying a set of rules that weren't even written by George Lucas. And this is why we need things like force-healing.</p>
  <h3>In Name Only Adaptations (i.e Super Mario Bros (1993))</h3>
  <img src="Super Mario Bros.png" alt="Goomba">
  <p>Now I think if we're really looking at this then we need to go back to the history of adaptations. Specifically the kind of comic book adaptations that felt like the only movies in cinemas a few years ago. In the 80s and 90s, being faithful to a comic book adaptation was never really considered necessary. They were considered more marketable brands than anything. I wasn't alive at that time, so I don't know if it was because the internet didn't really exist, and so trolls couldn't complain about them, but either way, films like <em>Batman (1989)</em>, while having the characters and settings of the comic books, didn't abide purely by those ideas, such as revealing that The Joker killed Batman's parents, an idea that wasn't present there (Full disclosure, I've never read a <em>Batman</em> comic, but I do know that much about them). I believe that around about now <em>Super Mario Bros (1993)</em> comes in. This is a film that discards pretty much everything about the source material, and if it keeps them, then in a different form entirely.</p>
  <p>The film was a massive flop, both critically and commercially, and it was around about the early 2000s, with the <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies as well as the rise of the franchise in general, that led to this idea of adaptation fidelity. Now <em>Super Mario Bros (1993)</em>, even discounting the fact that it's nothing like the game, isn't a good film. It feels like a midnight movie, with the setting being this horiffic, slightly cyberpunk city filled with mushroom fungus and horiffic lizard people. However, this album's unfaithfulness has led to a turn for the worst, because many criticisms of in name only adaptations don't really look at the film for what they are.</p>
  <p>Forcing a film to live up to the standards set by its predecessor is a bad way to judge films, because they often try to look at it in a way that it shouldn't be looked at. After all, films based on video games, shouldn't really be like video games. Unless the video game's already cinematic, at which then the film's pretty redundant. Many video games that have film adaptations didn't have a story that can be translated to cinema incredibly well. The most obvious example of this is <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, which is based on a game that's really just a wide-open sandbox, and being based on a film with really not much story led to it being given poor reviews, and generally considered a disappointment. <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)</em> is an example of a film trying to directly adapt a video game into a film and doing it in such a barebones way that the film really lacks anything, and feels less like a movie, and more like someone asked ChatGPT for a way to "Make money, and simultaneously redeem themselves in the eyes of fans". And  we can see here that this is when a film should be viewed on its own, and not viewed as how directly it adapts a story from a different medium to the big screen.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I really hope that after reading this that you can see how you shouldn't judge films based on your own personal preferences, because it doesn't judge them in an objective way. It's letting your own feels cloud your judgment of the legitimate quality of the film, because reviewing should be objective. And if something occurred that you didn't want to occur then basing your judgment of the film on that isn't actually letting the film be its own film. After all, you could just as easily say that the new <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> games after the film are bad because they're not like the film. This is a bad way for cinema reviewing to go, but if there are more websites, and more people believing in criticism like this one, then we can stop the internet from becoming like this. And this would be a really good thing. So tell all your friends about this website, and maybe everyone will be criticising films in a more clever way. And that's a good thing.</p>
